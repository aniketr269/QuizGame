# QuizGame
Create a simple quiz. User is asked 10 questions with choices given and he answers by inputting the choices via console. Once answered, user
should be moved to next question. At the end show the 
user how much did he score out of 10. User inputs
should be validated. Any invalid input should lead to
user being prompted to enter the valid answer choice
again for the same question.
Add an extra check that program terminates and lets the
user know he failed when he gets 4 answers wrong. For
example, if an user gets 4 out of first 6 itself wrong then
do not show the remaining questions and exit out telling
the user that he failed.
Questions and answers can be hard-coded. It would be
a great addition if you can keep a bank of 20-25
questions and show 10 randomly to the user
